# compare the following for tritone in  matrix
# 1. changing d from 1.1% to 1%
# 2. evaluating with auditory versus polarized auditory

###
# polarized, d=1.1%
# tritone is close to experimental studies
# but major triad is more consonant than tritone
# tritone is major-minor neutral

###
# polarized, d=1%
# tritone is heavily punished doesn't come close to experimental studies
# but major triad is less consonant than tritone
# tritone is major-minor neutral


###
# centered, d=1.1%
# tritone matches experimental studies for intervals without major-minor dimension
# but major triad is less consonant than the tritone
# tritone is major-minor neutral

###
# BEST PICK:
# centered, d=1%
# tritone is slightly worse than experimental studies, but major-minor helps?
# but major triad is more consonant than tritone
# tritone is major from below and minor from above
